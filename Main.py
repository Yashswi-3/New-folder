1️⃣ Pema’s Dawn Walk
Brief Description:
A solitary moment of quiet anticipation as Pema the red panda makes her pre‑dawn trek to school, savoring the stillness and magic of the misty hills.

Story Excerpt:

“Pema, a red panda with soft russet fur and thoughtful eyes, liked to walk to school before the village was fully awake. The hills were quiet then, and the clouds hung low like sleepy scarves across the trees. She took the winding path slowly, her paws making soft prints in the morning dew.”

Sensory Details:

Tactile: Pema’s paws make soft prints in the morning dew.

Visual: Low mist curls around the trees; clouds hang low “like sleepy scarves.”

Auditory: The hills are silent—an almost palpable stillness. \n
**Why this scene?**  
- Establishes Pema as the protagonist  
- Creates atmosphere with mist and dawn light  
- Shows solitude before friendships form  
- Visualizes key sensory detail: paw prints in dew

3️⃣ Kunu Points — Group’s Shared Awe
Brief Description:
Kunu rises as the silent guide, pointing toward the lifting clouds and sunlit peak, and the friends stand together, enraptured by nature’s awakening.

Story Excerpt:

“He didn’t speak right away. Kunu was a young goral—a nimble mountain goat with soft grey fur and steady steps. He simply nodded at the others, then pointed toward the mountain ridge.
A line of sunlight had just touched the snowcap above. The clouds were lifting.
‘Clear day,’ Kunu said softly. ‘You can see the whole peak.’
They stood for a moment, all five, watching the morning open up before them. The forest shimmered with birdsong. The air smelled of pine and slate.”

Sensory Details:

Auditory: A woodpecker taps on a pine; a goat bleats; the forest “shimmers with birdsong.”

Olfactory: The air “smells of pine and slate.”

Visual: Clouds lifting off the snowcap; sunlight touching the peak; mist receding.\n 
**Why this scene?**  
- Emotional climax of the story  
- Nature becomes the sixth character  
- Silhouettes focus on mountain reveal  
- Shows transition from mist to sunlight
